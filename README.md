### Compilation

---

This project can either be imported as an Eclipse Gradle project or compiled via command line.

To get the program to compile, change the `.settings/gradle.prefs` file so that the `project_dir` and `connection_project_dir` entries both point to the cloned repository (e.g. `"project_dir": "C:\\Users\\johndoe\\GitHub\\CodeMonkey",`).

If compiling via command line, make sure you have a `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to the JDK (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_91`).

### To Do

---

In the future we will implement the UI and probably improve the filtering a bit.
